            <p>At Compass Bible Church we are called to make disciples of Christ (Matthew 28:18-20). As we do,
                        we will always work to express and maintain these eight ministry values.</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">1. THE BIBLE IS CENTRAL</h2>
                <p>While the Bible is not an end in itself, it is certainly the indispensable &#8220;compass&#8221;
                            for our knowledge and understanding of God and his plan for our lives.</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">2. WE SHOWCASE EXPOSITORY PREACHING</h2>
                <p>Because God&#8217;s written revelation to us is &#8220;living and active and sharper than any
                            two-edged sword&#8221; it is our intention to allow it to utilize Compass preachers to get
                            to our hearts and minds as they open the word and let its message out. Our goal is that
                            Compass pastors won&#8217;t use the Bible to preach their messages, but that the Bible will
                            use Compass pastors to preach its message. God&#8217;s powerful and life-changing truth!</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">3. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A HIGH VIEW OF GOD</h2>
                <p>In a day when many have attempted to reduce God to be their spiritual therapist, it is
                            important for us to remember that God, our Creator, is the highly exalted, transcendent,
                            King of all things. We cannot afford to think less of God than he really is. We dare not
                            respond to him as merely our comfortable friend and fail to worship him as our Sovereign
                            Lord.</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">4. WE WORK TO PROCLAIM A BIBLICAL GOSPEL</h2>
                <p>It is imperative that we understand what God&#8217;s word says about how one becomes a
                            disciple of Christ and thus a child of God. We cannot truncate, sterilize, simplify, adjust
                            or in any other way modify the message of the gospel that was once and for all delivered to
                            God&#8217;s people in God&#8217;s word. We will not shy away from clearly articulating God&#8217;s
                            truth on heaven, hell, sin, judgment, repentance and faith. It will be our goal to hold
                            tightly to a biblical gospel.</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">5. WE HAVE A GENUINE RELIANCE ON PRAYER</h2>
                <p>We understand that the mission, the goals and the values at Compass Bible Church are humanly
                            impossible. We do not inherently possess the wherewithal to make disciples or aid them in
                            knowing, loving and serving Christ. These are works of God and we will always rely on him as
                            we ardently ask him to accomplish these biblical objectives among us.</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">6. WE HAVE HIGHLY COMMITTED PARTICIPANTS</h2>
                <p>To effectively and efficiently accomplish all that God has called us to do, we cannot
                            maintain the all-too-common &#8220;20% of the people do 80% of the work.&#8221; At Compass
                            we must always encourage that &#8220;each part does its work.&#8221; (Eph.4:16b)</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">7. WE WILL LOOK TO AUTHENTIC AND SACRIFICIAL LEADERS</h2>
                <p>The kind of people that God calls to lead at Compass Bible Church is extremely important.
                            Obviously our pastors and teachers must meet the biblical qualifications as set forth in the
                            books of 1 Timothy and Titus. Beyond that we expect our leaders to follow in Apostle Paul&#8217;s
                            example of being authentic, forthright, honest, hard-working and sacrificial. In a phrase we
                            expect that our leaders set the example of saying to Christ daily: &#8220;any thing, any
                            place, any time!&#8221;</p>

                <h2 class="tk-seravek-web">8. WE WILL ALWAYS BE WORKING TO PLANT NEW CHURCHES</h2>
                <p>It is our concern that we work to regularly launch more Bible-teaching churches that are
                            resolved and constrained to move into more communities with a biblical purpose, a biblical
                            mission and clearly maintained biblical values. It is our hope that Compass will never lose
                            its commitment to this end.</p>
